# Build Instructions

This builds an older version of c++filt that includes gcc v2 (and older?) name
demangling.  Newer versions still have it in the documenation, but the source
code for the feature was removed

* compile with -Wno-error to ignore all warning / keep all the bugs
* avoid building extra stuff, but want the good stuff!
